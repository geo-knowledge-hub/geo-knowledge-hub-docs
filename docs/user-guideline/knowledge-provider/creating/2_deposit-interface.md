After selecting the `Knowledge Provider option`, you will be redirected to the `GEO Knowledge Hub Deposit page`. On this page, you can create [Knowledge Packages](../../../concepts/sharing-units/knowledge-packages.md) and [Knowledge Resources](../../../concepts/sharing-units/knowledge-resources.md). An example of this page is presented below:

On this `Deposit page`, five sections of functionality can be used for building and sharing *Knowledge Packages* and *Knowledge Resources*:

1. `Selecting and linking communities`: Using this section, you can choose a [community](../../../concepts/communities.md) in which the *Knowledge Package* is intended to be published. Note this section is optional to use. For more information on how to use this section, please see the documentation for [submitting Knowledge Packages to a community](../linking/linking.md);

2. `Knowledge Package metadata`: Section where you can define metadata and associate files to the *Knowledge Package* you are creating. More details about this section will be presented in the following topics;

3. `Knowledge Resources interface`: Section that gives access to the interface where you can manage the *Knowledge Resources* that are associated with a *Knowledge Package*;

4. `Management menu`: Section in which there is a menu that allows the user to perform a `preview`, `save draft changes`, and `publish` the *Knowledge Package*. More details about this section will be presented in the following topics;

5. `Visibility menu`: Section where you can determine what permissions will be assigned to the *Package* and its *Resources*.

Each of the previously mentioned sections are shown in the figure below.
