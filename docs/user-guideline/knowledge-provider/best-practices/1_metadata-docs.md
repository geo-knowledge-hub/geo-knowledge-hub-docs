First of all, **clear documentation** is essential. It's crucial to provide comprehensive documentation that explains what your application does and how to use it. Think of it as a user manual â€” without clear instructions, users may struggle to understand and utilize your application effectively.
It's also recommended to keep your documentation simple, so both technical and non-technical users can understand your application and the data being used.

In addition to documentation, **descriptive metadata and data accessibility** are just as important. Metadata acts as a roadmap, guiding users to the information they need. Rich metadata provides much more value, making it easier for users to find, understand, and utilize the data effectively.

**On this matter**: We highly recommend reviewing the [GEO Data Sharing and Data Management Principles](https://doi.org/10.60566/3p7vv-ykj55) document as it helps you in managing and sharing data within the GEO community.
