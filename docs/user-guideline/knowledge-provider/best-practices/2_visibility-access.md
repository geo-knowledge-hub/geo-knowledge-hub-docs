**Visibility** is another factor and plays a key role. Sharing your publications, whether journal papers or conference proceedings, increases their visibility and impact and helps users understand the scientific basis of your *Knowledge Package*.

Equally important is **ensuring effortless access** to the full range of your products. Users should be able to access your application and its features without any barriers or complications. For instance, if it's a web platform you may provide a URL address or if it is a tool that runs locally on a computer provide a download file. Therefore, prioritize accessibility for users.
