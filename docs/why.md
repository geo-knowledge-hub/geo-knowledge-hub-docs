Sometimes questions arise about why the `GEO community` should use the `GEO Knowledge Hub`. This section presents answers to the top questions we receive. We hope to clear up your doubts about why you should consider starting to use the GEO digital library `today`!

### Who is it for ?

The answer to this question can have several points of view. So here we will focus on two main points of view:

**Users who need to access reproducible applications**

The `GEO Knowledge Hub` is mainly designed to allow technical users who look for open Earth Observations based solutions to be able to re-use it in their area of interest. Each of the `GEO Knowledge Hub` packages describes the type of users for which the EO application has been designed for.

Bringing the work of all the **GEO** **W**ork **P**rogramme activities together into one repository, allows the user to have a more complete overview of all the solutions/applications offered by GEO on any given problematic. Besides, users could be brought to specific EO applications through the `GEO Knowledge Hub` that might not find them otherwise. 

**Users who need to share and preserve reproducible applications**

Knowledge Providers have the possibility to register their open EO based applications in the Knowledge Hub and allowing users to understand, familiarize and re-use. It does allow GWP activities to establish synergies focusing on cross cutting areas.

Maintenance cost for knowledge packages is minimal, while exposure to the community is greater as `GEO Knowledge Hub` is the place for GEO to share knowledge and solutions available.  

The only further interaction needed from the knowledge provider is the occasional update as changes occur.

## What it can do for me ?

Inside the GEO Knowledge Hub, the user will find EO applications organized in *Knowledge Packages* with all the necessary components to learn and reuse the application shared. All the *Knowledge Resources* are directly shared, curated and organized by the Knowledge provider to ensure replicability with proper documentation. Each resource has its own page, with the related files and metadata, and every record is linked to a Knowledge Package, allowing the user to see how a particular record such as a dataset or a publication is part of an EO application
