Theâ€¯`GEO Knowledge Hub` is a central cloud-based digital library providing access to Earth Observations based applications developed by the GEO Work Programme Activities and other authoritative sources of EO based open applications.

## Scope

The scope of the `GEO Knowledge Hub` is to promote the replicability and re-usability of EO based applications by sharing with the end user all the Knowledge Resources essential to fully understand and re-use them. All knowledge resources of a registered EO application, are openly shared, curated and organized into a Knowledge Package, including:â€¯

1. Research papers and reports describing methods and results;
2. Software algorithms and cloud computing resources used for processing;
3. In situ and satellite imagery data used;
4. Results for verification

## Discover

Inside the `GEO Knowledge Hub`, the user will find EO Applications organized in Knowledge Packages with all the necessary components (Knowledge Resources). All the Knowledge Resources are directly shared, curated and organized by the Knowledge to ensure replicability with proper documentation.

Each resource has its own page, with the related files and metadata, and every record is linked to a Knowledge Package, allowing the user to see how a particular record such as a dataset or a publication is part of an EO application. In the `GEO Knowledge Hub`, several formats and resource types may be retrieved, including the following:

## Communities

Experts from the GEO community will use the `GEO Knowledge Hub` to share their work and make it easily reusable by others. The Communities feature of the `GEO Knowledge Hub` will help to organize the content of the EO Applications around thematic areas such as GEO Work Programme activities, GEO engagement priorities and Global Policy Frameworks.

The providers, as active members of these communities will have the possibility to manage their knowledge and to curate the records before they are published. End-users will be able to find records that are linked to a specific community, to facilitate retrieval of information.

Finally, through the different communities, end-users will also have the possibility to ask questions directly to the providers and get help from them if they encountered problems with the application.

## Contribute

The GEO Knowledge Hub offers you a place where you can make your solution visible and available to the rest of the world, in an open-knowledge approach! To ensure long term discoverability of your work, you will be able to assign DOI - * **D**igital **O**bject **I**dentifiers* and maintain it up to date with version management functionalities.
