Now, after you have defined your *Knowledge Package*, you can start adding *Knowledge Resources* to it. To do this, first access the `Knowledge Resources interface`, available in the [Deposit interface](2_deposit-interface.md). To do this, click the `Go to resources` button, as presented in the section [Acessing the Deposit interface](2_deposit-interface.md).

When you access the `Knowledge Resources interface`, you should see an interface like the one shown in the figure below:

<ImageContent
    imagePath={KnowledgeDepositSectionResourceFigure}
    imageAlt={"Knowledge Resources interface"}
/>

With this interface, it is possible to create and manage the *Knowledge Resources* of the *Knowledge Package*. For this, the interface has its functionalities divided into four main parts, which are:

1. `Return to Knowledge Package`: Button that allows you to return to the interface for managing the *Knowledge Package* `files` and `metadata`;

2. `Resources menu`: Menu to allow you to add *Knowledge Resources*. The details of this menu are presented on the following pages;

3. `Management menu`: *Knowledge Resources* management menu. Currently, it has functionalities that allow the management of *Resources* permissions;

4. `Operations menu`: Menu with operations that can be applied to the *Resources* of a *Package*. Currently, only the option to import resources is available. This option is used when a new version of the *Knowledge Package* is created. Please see the [Creating a New Version of a Package](../new-version/new-version.md) page to learn about using this menu.

Each of the parts described in the previous section are marked and shown in the figure below:
