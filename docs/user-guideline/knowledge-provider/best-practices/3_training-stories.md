**Providing access to training materials** is another critical aspect. For example, you might share training videos on YouTube or scripts and algorithms or maybe workshop materials stored on GitHub. So, sharing training materials helps users to get started and level up their skills and knowledge.

Another key aspect, sharing user stories. **User stories** can add a personal touch to your application. Sharing real-life examples of how your application has been used can inspire others and showcase its practical applications.
