Another important factor is **interacting with the community**. Engaging with users, gathering feedback, and fostering collaboration will create a vibrant ecosystem around your application. The GEO Knowledge Hub provides functionalities like `need training`, `ask provider` and `user feedback` to facilitate these interactions. Use them after the publication of your Knowledge Package!
