With the *Knowledge Resources* added to the *Package*, you can also manage their permissions with the `Management menu`. This specialized menu makes it easy to modify the permissions of several resources, avoiding the need to make [edits](7_editing-resource.md) to each *Resource* to complete this kind of task.

To perform this operation, first click on the `View` button of the `Permissions` item that is available in the [Management menu](2_deposit-interface.md):

<ImageContent
    imagePath={KnowledgeDepositSectionResourcePermissionButtonFigure}
    imageAlt={"Permission management item"}
/>

After that, a permissions editing window will open. With this menu you can modify the **Full record** and **Files only** options of each *Resource* without editing them directly:

<ImageContent
    imagePath={KnowledgeDepositSectionResourcePermissionManagementFigure}
    imageAlt={"Permission management window"}
/>

:::caution

Note that if a *Knowledge Resource* has been added to the *Package* with the `Attach` option, it cannot be edited, as mentioned in the previous pages.
