After you have added *Knowledge Resources* to the *Package*, you can edit them. To do this, you can use the `Options` button to the right of each of the *Resources* you have created. By clicking on this button, as shown in the figure below, you can do

- `Editing the metadata`: Opens the metadata editing window, allowing modifications to be made;

- `Detach the Resource from the Package`: The Resource is removed from the Package, but it is still available in the system and can be reused in another package;

- `Resource deletion`: The Resource is deleted from the system.

:::caution

Only created *Knowledge Resources* can be modified. Existing *Resources* linked to a *Package* have no editing options. This is because, as mentioned, you can only change these *Resources* in the *Package* that created them.
