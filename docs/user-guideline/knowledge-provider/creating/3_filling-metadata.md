After accessing and understanding the `Deposit interface`, the first step required to create a Knowledge Package is to fill in the metadata fields. These fields are part of the `Knowledge Package metadata` section presented earlier.

To help you fill in this metadata, below is a table where each field is described. Along with this, examples and tips on how to fill in these fields are also presented.

<Tabs>
    <TabItemContent
        value="files"
        label="Files"
        default   
    >
        <h2>Files</h2>
        <div>
            <div>
                The <code>files</code> section allows you to upload the files associated with the <i>Knowledge Package</i>. For this case, consider that the file in a <i>Knowledge Package</i> does not represent a <i>Knowledge Resource</i>. Instead, it is recommended that files defined directly in the <i>Package</i> have contents that describe the <i>Package</i> itself.
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
                You should note that if no files are to be added to the <i>Knowledge Package</i>, you must set the <code>Metadata-only record</code> option.
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
                The figure below shows how this section can be filled out. In this case, a file in <code>PDF</code> format was uploaded.
            </div>
        </div>
        <ImageContent
            imagePath={KnowledgeDepositSectionFilesFigure}
            imageAlt={"File section"}
        />
    </TabItemContent>
    <TabItemContent
        value="basic-information"
        label="Basic information"
    >
        <h2>Basic information</h2>
        The <code>Basic information</code> section allows you to define information such as <code>title</code> and <code>publication date</code>. You can also specify a DOI - <b>D</b>igital <b>O</b>bject <b>I</b>dentifier in this section. For this, two options are available:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Using an existing DOI</b>: In this case, you use a previously defined DOI. For example, if you add an already published file, you can use the already defined DOI. This avoids DOI duplication for the same object;
                <br />
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Creating a new DOI</b>: If you do not have one, you can generate and assign a DOI for the Knowledge Package. <code>GEO Knowledge Hub</code> will manage this new DOI.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <div>
            The figure below shows how this section can be filled out.
        </div>
        <ImageContent

        />
    </TabItemContent>
    <TabItemContent
        value="description-languages"
        label="Description and languages"
    >
        <h2>Description and languages</h2>
        The <code>Description and languages</code> section allows you to add a description and set the language of the package materials. Also, additional descriptions can be attached (e.g., <code>Table of contents</code>, <code>technical information</code>, and so on).
        <br />
        <br />
        <div>
            The figure below shows how this section can be filled out.
        </div>
        <ImageContent

        />
    </TabItemContent>
        <TabItemContent
        value="people"
        label="People"
    >
        <h2>People</h2>
        The <code>People</code> section is where you can define the creators and contributors of the <i>Knowledge Package</i>. For both information, people and organizations can be associated. For each of these, you can define, besides the name, information such as <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID</a> and role in the <i>Package</i> (e.g., <code>Author</code>, <code>Hosting institution</code>, and so on).
        <br />
        <br />
        <div>
            The figure below shows how this section can be filled out.
        </div>
        <ImageContent
            imagePath={KnowledgeDepositSectionPeopleFigure}
            imageAlt={"People section"}
        />
    </TabItemContent>
    <TabItemContent
        value="initiatives-audiences"
        label="Initiatives, audiences and subjects"
    >
        <h2>Initiatives, audiences and subjects</h2>
        The <code>subjects</code> are the first metadata you can add in the <code>Initiatives, audiences, and subjects</code> section. For this, it is possible to search for a default list of values or add a new subject. The default values are from the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/science/inno/38235147.pdf" target="_blank">OECD Field of Science (FOS)</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this section, you can also define the <code>GEO Work Programme Activity</code>associated with the <i>Knowledge Package</i> being created (e.g., <a href="https://www.earthobservations.org/geoglam.php">GEOGLAM</a>, <a href="https://www.geoglows.org/">GEOGLOWS</a>, and others). Along with this, you can define the <code>Engagement Priorities</code> related to the package (e.g., SDGs, Paris agreement, and others).
        <br />
        <br />
        Finally, you can also add <code>Target Audiences</code> indicating to which type of user the application and their knowledge might be useful.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div>
            The figure below shows how this section can be filled out.
        </div>
        <ImageContent
            imagePath={KnowledgeDepositSectionInitiativeFigure}
            imageAlt={"Initiatives, audiences and subjects"}
        />
    </TabItemContent>
    <TabItemContent
        value="dates-versions"
        label="Dates and versions"
    >
        <h2>Dates and versions</h2>
        In <code>Dates and versions</code>, you can add the <i>Package</i> version, along with relevant dates about it (e.g., <code>creation date</code>, <code>update date</code>, and so on).
        <br />
        <br />
        You should note that the definition of <code>versions</code> does not have any rules. Also, it is essential to note that these versions, because they can be defined arbitrarily, are not used in the versioning mechanisms of <code>GEO Knowledge Hub</code>.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div>
            The figure below shows how this section can be filled out.
        </div>
        <ImageContent

        />
    </TabItemContent>
    <TabItemContent
        value="geographic-locations"
        label="Geographic locations"
    >
        <h2>Geographic locations</h2>
        The <code>Geographic locations</code> is the section where you can define spatial information about the <i>Knowledge Package</i> and its contents. For this, in addition to an interactive map, you are provided with the possibility to upload <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946">GeoJSON</a> files. You can also define locations using <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</a> identifiers.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div>
            The figure below shows how this section can be filled out.
        </div>
        <ImageContent

            imageAlt={"Geographic location section"}
        />
    </TabItemContent>
    <TabItemContent
        value="publiser-licenses"
        label="Publisher and licenses"
    >
        <h2>Publisher and licenses</h2>
        In the <code>Publisher and licenses</code> section, it is possible to define who was the first <code>Publisher</code> of the work. This is useful when the material is submitted to the <code>GEO Knowledge Hub</code> even though it has already been published. You can also define a <code>License</code> for the content of the <i>Knowledge Package</i>. This does not include <i>Knowledge Resources</i>, which may have their own licenses.
        <br />
        <br />
        The main licenses recommended in <code>GEO Knowledge Hub</code> were defined based on the <a href="https://gkhub.earthobservations.org/packages/pxdag-hq931" target="_blank">GEO Data Sharing principles</a>.
        <br />
        <br />

        />
    </TabItemContent>
    <TabItemContent
        value="related-links"
        label="Related Links"
    >
        <h2>Related links</h2>
        The <code>Related links</code> section is where you can define all the materials related to the <i>Knowledge Package</i> you are creating. This includes all kinds of material, from presentations to other <i>Knowledge Packages</i>.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div>
            The figure below shows how this section can be filled out.

When you have finished editing the Knowledge Package metadata, it is recommended that you save the changes you have made. To do this, click the `Save draft` button in the [Management menu](2_deposit-interface.md). This will ensure you retain the information you have added.

Also, a good practice related to the persistence of your changes is to **always** save after adding new information.
