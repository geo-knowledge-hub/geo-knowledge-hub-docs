To use the `GEO Knowledge Hub`, at first, it is not necessary to create an account. For example, suppose you want to explore the materials and use the Knowledge Packages. In that case, you do not need to create an account. However, if you wish to [interact with the community](../interacting/interacting.md) or become a [Knowledge Provider](../../../concepts/user-roles.md#knowledge-provider), you need so.

On this page, you will find the step-by-step instructions for creating a new account on the `GEO Knowledge Hub`.

### Step-by-step

To create an account, follow the step-by-step instructions presented in the following topics.

#### 1. Acessing the GEO Knowledge Hub

To create an account, first, access the `GEO Knowledge Hub`. To do this, use the following address: https://gkhub.earthobservations.org/.

You now have an account on the `GEO Knowledge Hub`. With this, you can access the contents of the digital library and [interact](../interacting/interacting.md) with the community.

By default, the account you create has the [Knowledge User](../../../concepts/user-roles.md#knowledge-user) [role](../../../concepts/user-roles.md). If you wish to become a [Knowledge Provider](../../../concepts/user-roles.md#knowledge-provider), please refer to the section [User role - Knowledge Provider](../../../concepts/user-roles.md#knowledge-provider).
