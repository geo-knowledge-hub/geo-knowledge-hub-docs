To create a [Knowledge Package](../../../concepts/sharing-units/knowledge-packages.md), your `GEO Knowledge Hub user` must have the [Knowledge Provider](../../../concepts/user-roles.md#knowledge-provider) [role](../../../concepts/user-roles.md). If you do not have this permission, [create an account](../../knowledge-user/creating-account/creating-account.md) and [request the required role](../../../concepts/user-roles.md#knowledge-provider) for the `GEO Knowledge Hub team`.

Sharing Earth Observation Applications in the `GEO Knowledge Hub` is done through [Knowledge Package](../../../concepts/sharing-units/knowledge-packages.md) creation.
